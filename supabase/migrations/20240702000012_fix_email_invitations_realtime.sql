-- This migration fixes the issue with email_invitations already being in the supabase_realtime publication
-- by doing nothing, since the table is already added to the publication

-- Just a comment to explain what's happening
-- The previous migration (20240702000011_fix_email_invitations_realtime.sql) already added the table to the publication
-- so we don't need to add it again
